# Dress Code

This is a social club for professionals. As such, member attire is expected to loosely adhere to a business casual dress code. Business casual attire includes but is not limited to: slacks, dresses, dress shirts, dress pants and skirts, pantsuits, blouses, sweaters, short sleeve shirts, and jeans. All footwear except flip flops are accepted.

Still not sure what to wear? If you'd wear it to an after-work mixer, it's probably business casual!
