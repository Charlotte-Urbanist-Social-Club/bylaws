# Dress Code

All Members and their guests must follow the dress code at all times while visiting the Club, the Clubhouse, and any Club events.

The goal is to be casual and open, but not needlessly revealing. We are a casual social club, not a nightclub.

* Clean clothes without holes.
* No exposed midriff.
* Shoes required. No flip flops.
