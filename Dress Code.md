# Dress Code

All members and their guests must follow the dress code at all times while visiting the club.

The goal is to be casual and open, but not needlessly revealing. We're a casual social club, not a nightclub.

* Men must wear a shirt with sleeves. Women must wear a shirt/top with sleeves or a collar.
  * A t-shirt is acceptable.
* Pants, shorts, or skirts that go down to the knee are required.
  * Shorts or skirts no shorter than 6 inches above the knees are allowed when wearing stockings, pantyhose, or leggings.
  * Jeans are acceptable.
  * Leggings alone do not count as pants.
* No exposed midriff.
* Dresses are acceptable if they meet the above requirements for tops and skirts.
* Shoes required. No flip flops.
