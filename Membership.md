# Membership

## Nondiscrimination Policy
Membership in the Club, and the appointment to any Office of the Club, shall not be denied or abridged by race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, national origin, nationality, citizenship, or disability status, and cannot be denied to anyone eighteen years of age or older on account of age.

## Code of Conduct

1. Bullying or harassment by any Member shall not be tolerated.

1. Cursing is discouraged in the Clubhouse and at Club events.

## Suspension and Expulsion

1. The Board of Directors may, at their own discretion, suspend or terminate a person's membership in the Club.

    > ⚠️ Pursuant to NC General Statutes §55A-6-31, the Board must conduct these proceedings “in a manner that is fair and reasonable” and must be “carried out in good faith.”

    > ℹ️ In North Carolina, members do not have the right to notice nor to an opportunity to be heard, unless the club's governing documents (Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws) require it.
    > Regardless, giving notice and an opportunity to be heard before the vote will likely put the club in the best light before a court of law.

2. The person whose membership has been suspended or terminated may be given an opportunity to appeal the decision to the Board of Directors within one year following the Board's vote.

3. If the person to be suspended or expelled is a Director, they cannot cast a vote on their own suspension or expulsion.
