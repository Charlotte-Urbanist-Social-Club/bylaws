    > ⚠️ Pursuant to NC General Statutes §55A-6-31, the Board must conduct these proceedings “in a manner that is fair and reasonable” and must be “carried out in good faith.”

    > ℹ️ In North Carolina, members do not have the right to notice nor to an opportunity to be heard, unless the club's governing documents (Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws) require it.
    > Regardless, giving notice and an opportunity to be heard before the vote will likely put the club in the best light before a court of law.

2. The person whose membership has been suspended or terminated may be given an opportunity to appeal the decision to the Board of Directors within one year following the Board's vote.
