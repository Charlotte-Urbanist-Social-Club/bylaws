# Charlotte Urbanist Social Club

Part urbanist discussion group, part board game group, all fun in Charlotte.

This repository shall serve as record of bylaws for our organization.

## Broad Goals for Club

1. We're working to build a clubhouse where people can enjoy board games, come and go as they please, stay as long as they please, and with no need to pay for food or drinks.
2. We are Urbanists of Charlotte and want to build a better city. Often times the best ideas come about when people are relaxing and socializing.
